\section{Acadia University}

Once the microscope was constructed, images could be taken in the lab. Many
biological objects were tried, but due to the amount of objects in the
three-dimensional space, there became too many fridges to resolve into a
reconstruction. The reconstructions could be done, but no details could be
seen.

Like the images obtained from Harvard University, some of the objects shown are
objects that appeared in the slide without intention, but made for interesting
holograms and reconstructions. With the CCD that was used in the microscope,
the spacing per pixel was about twice that of the Harvard images at around 0.34
microns. The image size was 4000 by 3000 pixels.

All of the images taken in the lab at Acadia University have a high resolution.
This resolution was obtained with a minimum setup, and saving resources when
they could be spared.
Figures~\ref{fig:85_88},~\ref{fig:187_200},~\ref{fig:198_200} display how small
the pixel resolution gets. In these images, the object is colloidal silica
which has a diameter of around 5 microns.

In Figure~\ref{fig:72_74}, the object is very small, and the level of detail is
still high. This image is interesting because of the way it overlaps on itself,
and the fridges overlap, and yet the reconstruction has a high resolution.
In Figures~\ref{fig:187_200} and~\ref{fig:198_200}, the difference between two
different dilutions of the same solution are shown. In this instance, it didn't
matter, but one could see that if the densely populated hologram got too much
more populated, the fridges could case a lose of resolution, and when the
objects are 5 microns, this could result in objects missing, or a
reconstruction so overcrowded that objects could not be distinguished from one
another.

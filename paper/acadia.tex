\section{Acadia University}

%Once the microscope was constructed, images could be taken in the lab. Many
%biological objects were tried, but due to the amount of objects in the
%three-dimensional space, there became too many fridges to resolve into a
%reconstruction. The reconstructions could be done, but no details could be
%seen.

A series of holograms were recorded using the apparatus displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:OurMicroscope}.

As with the images obtained from Harvard University, some of the objects shown are
objects that appeared in the slide without intention but made for interesting
holograms and reconstructions. With the CCD that was used in the microscope,
the spacing per pixel was about twice that of the Harvard images at
approximately 0.34
microns. The image size was 4000 by 3000 pixels, and hence the images were
\SI{1360}{\micro\meter} by \SI{1020}{\micro\meter} in the $x$ and $y$
dimensions, respectively. The values of $z$ used for
reconstructions in the Acadia images are larger since the objects were farther
away from the CCD than in the Harvard images.

%In Figure~\ref{fig:68_74} the object was a fibre from the lens tissue used to
The object in Figure~\ref{fig:68_74} was a fibre from the lens tissue used to
clean the slide. This fibre was found in the hologram and then after the
hologram was captured the slide was repositioned to take the in-focus
holographic image.
This demonstrates an advantage of holography over optical bright-field
microscopy. In a bright-field microscope this object might have been
overlooked since the fibre was not at the focal length of the objective lens. Holography allowed for
this object to be found and reconstructed without the need to find the focal
plane of the object. 
%This fibre also had a lot of fringes that were spaced
%appropriately so that a detailed reconstruction could still be achieved. 
%The fringe spacing is high because the object was so far away from the CCD, which
%is why the reconstruction could still be done with the object being 1.26 cm
%away from the CCD.

Figure~\ref{fig:72_74} was captured while trying to view a solution of
colloidal diamond, but the object, which was probably dust, was imaged. This made
for an interesting reconstruction since the object had a loop in it. Even
though there are interfering fringes at the loop, which was thought might cause
a loss of resolution and make the space between the object
unrecognizable, the loop was still able to be resolved. The largest spacing
between two sides of the loop was approximately \SI{23}{\micro\meter}.
%, which
%gave confidence that the resolution of the microscope was at least
%\SI{23}{\micro\meter}.

Figures~\ref{fig:187_200} and~\ref{fig:198_200} were images of colloidal diamond
with a particle diameter of about \SI{5}{\micro\meter}.
In Figure~\ref{fig:187_200}, the
solution used was highly populated and fringes overlapped with one another.
This was not ideal as overlapping fringes can cause a reduction in
resolution. However, the 5 micron particles were still clearly resolved.
%Figure~\ref{fig:198_200} was 
A more diluted solution of colloidal diamond that
had a population more ideally suited for recording holograms is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:198_200}.
Some of the
particles are very close to one another and yet they were still resolved
into two distinct 5 micron particles, as shown at spot $i$. 
A line scan of these two particles was performed and a fit was made with two
%shown at spot $i.$, a fit can be made with two
Gaussian distributions. In Figure~\ref{fig:linescan}, the two
Gaussians and their sum fit along with the original data gathered from Figure~\ref{fig:198_200}
(c) are presented. Using the individual fits of the Gaussians, along with their sum, the resolution could be
determined by moving one Gaussian toward the other until two distinct Gaussians
could no longer be recognized. This is known as the Rayleigh
criterion. 
%which states that 
When the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of two Gaussians
are directly overlapping, then this defines the minimum resolvable separation
between the two Gaussians. Equation \ref{eq:Rayleigh} is the mathematical
formulation of the Rayleigh criterion,

\begin{equation}
    \delta_{Rayleigh} \propto \frac{\lambda}{NA}
    \label{eq:Rayleigh}
\end{equation}
%
where $\delta$ is the minimum resolvable separation, $\lambda$ is the
wavelength of the laser, and $NA$ is the numerical aperture of the optical
system \cite{Goodman}.
The separation of the FWHM on each of the individual Gaussians was
approximately 5 microns which corresponded closely to the known particle size and
showed that the individual fits were able to reliably model the particles in this
scenario.


In Figure~\ref{fig:linescan} (c), the Rayleigh criterion is shown, with
$\delta= ~$\SI{2.72}{\micro\meter}. Once the FWHM of each of the Gaussians move past one
another, as displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:linescan} (d), the sum of the
Gaussians can no longer be displayed as two distinct particles. The $NA$ of the
objective lens used in Figure~\ref{fig:OurMicroscope} was 0.25
and using
%, which allowed us to use 
Equation~\ref{eq:Rayleigh} to determine the theoretical minimum
separation of two particles that could still be resolvable,
\begin{equation}
    \delta_{Rayleigh} \propto \frac{635~\mathrm{nm}}{0.25} = 2540~\mathrm{nm} =
    2.54~\mathrm{\SI{}{\micro\meter}} ,
\end{equation}
which is close to the value obtained in Figure~\ref{fig:linescan} (c).
This gives confidence in the results obtained and indicates that the particles
can be resolved up to a lateral
geometrical distance apart of approximately
\SI{2.5}{\micro\meter}.

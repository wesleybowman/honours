\section{Acadia University}

%Once the microscope was constructed, images could be taken in the lab. Many
%biological objects were tried, but due to the amount of objects in the
%three-dimensional space, there became too many fridges to resolve into a
%reconstruction. The reconstructions could be done, but no details could be
%seen.

Like the images obtained from Harvard University, some of the objects shown are
objects that appeared in the slide without intention, but made for interesting
holograms and reconstructions. With the CCD that was used in the microscope,
the spacing per pixel was about twice that of the Harvard images at around 0.34
microns. The image size was 4000 by 3000 pixels, therefore the images were
\SI{1360}{\micro\meter} by \SI{1020}{\micro\meter}. The values of $z$ used for
reconstructions in the Acadia images are larger, since the objects were farther
away from the CCD than in the Harvard images.

In Figure~\ref{fig:68_74}, the object was a fibre from the lens tissue used to
clean the slide. This fibre was found in the hologram, and then after the
hologram was captured, the slide was repositioned to take the in-focus image.
This demonstrates an advantage of holography over optical bright field
microscopy, because in the bright field microscope this object might have been
overlooked since the fibre was not at the focal length. Holography allowed for
this object to be found and reconstructed without the need to find the focal
plane of the object.

Figure~\ref{fig:72_74} was captured while trying to view a solution of
colloidal diamond, but the object, which is probably dust, was found. This made
for an interesting reconstruction, since the object has a loop in it. Even
though there are interfering fringes at the loop, which was thought might cause
a loss of resolution at the loop, making the space between the object
unrecognizable, the loop was still able to be resolved.

Figures~\ref{fig:187_200} and~\ref{fig:198_200} were of colloidal diamond,
which had a diameter of around five microns. In Figure~\ref{fig:187_200}, the
solution used was highly populated, with fringes overlapping with one another.
This was not ideal, as interference can cause resolution to be lost, but the
reconstruction was done and the 5 micron particles were still resolved.
Figure~\ref{fig:198_200} was a more diluted solution of colloidal diamond, and
had a population that was typically looked for in the holograms. Some of the
particles here are very close to one another, and yet they were still resolved
into two distinct 5 micron particles, which is shown at spot $i$.

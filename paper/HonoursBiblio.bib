	abstract = {This article describes the principles and major applications of digital recording and numerical reconstruction of holograms (digital holography). Digital holography became feasible since charged coupled devices ({CCDs)} with suitable numbers and sizes of pixels and computers with sufficient speed became available. The Fresnel or Fourier holograms are recorded directly by the {CCD} and stored digitally. No film material involving wet-chemical or other processing is necessary. The reconstruction of the wavefield, which is done optically by illumination of a hologram, is performed by numerical methods. The numerical reconstruction process is based on the {Fresnel–Kirchhoff} integral, which describes the diffraction of the reconstructing wave at the micro-structure of the hologram. In the numerical reconstruction process not only the intensity, but also the phase distribution of the stored wavefield can be computed from the digital hologram. This offers new possibilities for a variety of applications. Digital holography is applied to measure shape and surface deformation of opaque bodies and refractive index fields within transparent media. Further applications are imaging and microscopy, where it is advantageous to refocus the area under investigation by numerical methods.},

\chapter{Holographic Microscopy} \label{chap:Micro}

One of the main goals of this research was to construct a microscope that was
able to create holograms that could be reconstructed numerically. To achieve
this, two different techniques were tried, pinhole holography and plane-wave
holography. All parts used where placed on a
optical rail that was horizontal.

%\section{Pinhole Holograms}
%This was the first microscope that was tried in the lab. This microscope
%consisted of a laser, a pinhole, the object to be reconstructed, and a charged
%coupled device, or a CCD.
%
%A 632 nm laser was mostly used, but a 450 nm laser was tested at one point as
%well to see if it helped the resolution and intensity. The pinhole needed to be
%small, so a \SI{10}{\micro\meter}, \SI{5}{\micro\meter}, \SI{1}{\micro\meter} pinhole was used. The smaller the
%aperture, the higher the resolution could be. The samples were nothing in
%particular for this stage, as it was a testing stage to see if reconstructions
%could be done with the setup, therefore hairs or fibre optic cables were used
%for the sample. The CCD used was a webcam, since it was an effective CCD for
%the price, and since this was still in the testing process it didn't feel
%necessary to go overboard with an expensive CCD.
%
%The problem with this setup was that it lead to a point source illumination
%which lead to spherical propagation of light after the aperture. This created
%a problem in the reconstruction, since the reconstruction methods that were
%being used were for plane-wave holography. Another problem was that to do
%pinhole holography, you have to be very precise with the laser hitting the
%pinhole, and then very precise with the rest of the equipment placing after the
%pinhole as well. The camera needs to get very close to the object, and the
%object needs to be close to the pinhole. The amount of precision needed was
%just not possible with the equipment that we had available.

\section{Plane-Wave Holography}

A simple form of holography, and one that was tolerant to imperfections in the
experimental setup, plane-wave holography was attempted. This
setup entailed of a laser, two objectives, the sample, and a CCD\@. There was
also the optional part of a neutral density filter (ND filter), which allowed for the
intensity of light to be adjusted so as not to saturate the CCD\@.
The optical power of a ND filter could be found using
Equation~\ref{eq:ND},

\begin{equation}
    d = -\log_{10}\frac{I}{I_0}
    \label{eq:ND}
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the optical density, $I_0$ is the initial intensity, and $I$ is
the measurable intensity after the ND filter.
A diagram of
the setup and the actual setup used are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:inlineSetup}
and in Figure~\ref{fig:OurMicroscope} respectively.

A 632 nm, 0.5 mW helium-neon, or HeNe, laser was mostly used, but a 450 nm, 1 W laser was tested at one point as
well to see if it helped the resolution and intensity.
%The same
%lasers used in the pinhole setup were used here. 
The CCD used was from an interchangeable lens camera.
Interchangeable lens cameras have no mirrors or prisms in front of
their CCD\@, which allowed for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 camera body only to
be bought, since there was no need for a lens. The CCD was directly
exposed to the incoming light, which allowed for minimal aberrations.

The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 camera allowed for high shutter speeds, low ISO
(which means low noise), and approximately 12 millions pixels.
The two objectives were used
before and after the sample in the setup. The first objective, which was a 10x
objective lens, was there for
the culmination of the light from the laser. This was not needed if the laser
has a culminated beam on its own. The second objective, which was a 20x
objective lens, was there to
magnify the resulting diffraction or interference patterns that were created
when the light passes through the sample. This allowed for the holograms to be
better recorded on the CCD, as it allowed the CCD to be fully used.
Both of the objectives and the object were placed on
three-axis mounts so that they could be adjusted and lined up properly.
The Edmund optics neutral density filters were used depending on the sample
that was being viewed, and if the CCD was being saturated. Saturating the CCD does not allow for a good hologram reconstruction
since some of the information is missing.
There were three different ND filters with
different optical density values used: 1.0, 0.6,
and a 0.3. This allowed for the intensity of the light from the laser to be
adjusted.
The ND filter went after the laser
and before the first objective. It was placed here for ease of use and access,
but could be moved to anywhere in the setup.

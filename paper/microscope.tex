\chapter{Holographic Microscope} \label{chap:Micro}

One of the main goals of this research was to construct a microscope that was
able to create holograms that could be reconstructed numerically. To achieve
this, two different techniques were tried. All parts used where placed on a
optical rail that was horizontal.

\section{Pinhole Holograms}
This was the first microscope that was tried in the lab. This microscope
consisted of a laser, a pinhole, the object to be reconstructed, and a charged
coupled device, or a CCD.

A 632 nm laser was mostly used, but a 450 nm laser was tested at one point as
well to see if it helped the resolution and intensity. The pinhole needed to be
small, so a \SI{10}{\micro\meter}, \SI{5}{\micro\meter}, \SI{1}{\micro\meter} pinhole was used. The smaller the
aperture, the higher the resolution could be. The samples were nothing in
particular for this stage, as it was a testing stage to see if reconstructions
could be done with the setup, therefore hairs or fibre optic cables were used
for the sample. The CCD used was a webcam, since it was an effective CCD for
the price, and since this was still in the testing process it didn't feel
necessary to go overboard with an expensive CCD.

The problem with this setup was that it lead to a point source illumination
which lead to spherical propagation of light after the aperture. This created
a problem in the reconstruction, since the reconstruction methods that were
being used were for plane-wave holography. Another problem was that to do
pinhole holography, you have to be very precise with the laser hitting the
pinhole, and then very precise with the rest of the equipment placing after the
pinhole as well. The camera needs to get very close to the object, and the
object needs to be close to the pinhole. The amount of precision needed was
just not possible with the equipment that we had available.


\section{Plane-Wave Holograms}
After a trip to the Manoharan Lab at Harvard University, it was realized that
pinhole holography was not the way to go for a lab just starting up. This is
why the next microscope built was a plane-wave holography microscope. This
setup entailed of a laser, two objectives, the sample, and a CCD\@. There was
also the optional part of a neutral density filter (ND filter), which allowed for the
intensity of light to be adjusted so as not to saturate the CCD\@. A diagram of
the setup and the actual setup used are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:inlineSetup}
and in Figures~\ref{fig:OurMicroscopeSide}-\ref{fig:OurMicroscopeUp} respectively.

The same
lasers used in the pinhole setup were used here. The CCD was upgraded to an interchangeable
lens camera. Interchangeable lens cameras have no mirrors or prisms in front of
their CCD\@. This allowed us to buy the camera body only, and the CCD is directly
exposed to the incoming light, which allowed for minimal aberrations. This new
camera was a big step in resolution for our images. The two objectives were used
before and after the sample in the setup. The first objective is there for
the culmination of the light from the laser. This is not needed if your laser
has a culminated beam on its own. The second objective is there to
magnify the resulting diffraction or interference patterns that are created
when the light passes through the sample. This allowed for the holograms to be
better recorded on the CCD, as it allowed the CCD to be fully used. This can be
done since every part of the hologram holds all the information needed to
reconstructed the object. Both objectives and the object were placed on
three-axis mounts so that they could be adjusted and lined up properly.
The neutral
density filter was used depending on the sample that was being viewed, and if the CCD was being
saturated. Saturating the CCD does not allow for a good hologram reconstruction
since some of the information is missing. The ND filter went after the laser
and before the first objective. It was placed here for ease of use and access.

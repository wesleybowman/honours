\chapter{Holographic Microscopy Apparatus} \label{chap:Micro}

%One of the main goals of this research was to construct a microscope that was
%able to create holograms that could be reconstructed numerically and the 
%technique implemented was in-line, plane-wave
%holography.

%All parts used where placed on a
%optical rail that was horizontal.

%\section{Pinhole Holograms}
%This was the first microscope that was tried in the lab. This microscope
%consisted of a laser, a pinhole, the object to be reconstructed, and a charged
%coupled device, or a CCD.
%
%A 632 nm laser was mostly used, but a 450 nm laser was tested at one point as
%well to see if it helped the resolution and intensity. The pinhole needed to be
%small, so a \SI{10}{\micro\meter}, \SI{5}{\micro\meter}, \SI{1}{\micro\meter} pinhole was used. The smaller the
%aperture, the higher the resolution could be. The samples were nothing in
%particular for this stage, as it was a testing stage to see if reconstructions
%could be done with the setup, therefore hairs or fibre optic cables were used
%for the sample. The CCD used was a webcam, since it was an effective CCD for
%the price, and since this was still in the testing process it didn't feel
%necessary to go overboard with an expensive CCD.
%
%The problem with this setup was that it lead to a point source illumination
%which lead to spherical propagation of light after the aperture. This created
%a problem in the reconstruction, since the reconstruction methods that were
%being used were for plane-wave holography. Another problem was that to do
%pinhole holography, you have to be very precise with the laser hitting the
%pinhole, and then very precise with the rest of the equipment placing after the
%pinhole as well. The camera needs to get very close to the object, and the
%object needs to be close to the pinhole. The amount of precision needed was
%just not possible with the equipment that we had available.

%\section{Plane-Wave Holography}

A simple form of holography that was tolerant to imperfections in the
experimental setup, plane-wave holography was used in this work. This
setup consisted of a laser, two objective lenses, the sample, and a CCD\@. There was
also a neutral density filter (ND filter) that could be inserted after the
laser to lower the
%which allowed for the
intensity of light and
%to be adjusted so as not to 
prevent saturation of the CCD\@.
The optical density, or absorbance, of a ND filter is defined as,

\begin{equation}
    d = -\log_{10}\frac{I}{I_0},
    \label{eq:ND}
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the optical density, $I_0$ is the initial intensity, and $I$ is
the intensity after the ND filter.
A schematic diagram of
the experimental setup and the actual setup used are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:inlineSetup}
and~\ref{fig:OurMicroscope}, respectively.

A 632 nm, 0.5 mW helium-neon laser was used as the coherent light
source.
%The same
%lasers used in the pinhole setup were used here. 
The CCD was a Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 interchangeable lens camera.
Interchangeable lens cameras have an important advantage over normal digital
cameras in that they have no mirrors or prisms in front of
the CCD\@, which allowed for direct exposure of the incoming light with minimal
aberrations.
%the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 camera body only to
%be bought, since there was no need for a lens. The CCD was directly
%exposed to the incoming light, which allowed for minimal aberrations.

The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 camera also allowed for high shutter speeds, low ISO
%(which means low noise),
and had approximately 12 million pixels.
The two objective lenses were used
before and after the sample in the setup. The first objective, which was a 10x
objective lens, was to %there for
culminate the light from the laser and would not be needed if the laser
had a collimated beam of appropriate diameter. The purpose of the second
objective lens, which was a 20x
objective lens, was to
magnify the resulting interference patterns created
when the light passed through the sample. This allowed for the holograms to be
recorded onto the CCD using the full area of the CCD.

Both of the objective lenses and the object were placed on
three-axis mounts so that they could be adjusted and aligned accurately.

The three different optical density values used were 1.0, 0.6,
and a 0.3, allowing for the intensity of the light from the laser to be
adjusted over a wide range.

\chapter{Results and Discussion} \label{chap:Results}

Two sets of experimental holograms were obtained at Harvard and Acadia
Universities and are reported in this chapter. The main goal was to achieve
high resolution holograms that correctly reconstructed the objects in the
holographic images. The holographic images taken at Harvard University were
used as a reference to make sure that the images obtained from Acadia
University and that the reconstruction procedure were correct.

\section{Harvard University}

As mentioned previously, HoloPy was the open-source Python module used for all
of the image reconstructions
done, and was developed by the Manoharan Lab, a world leader in optical
holography research \cite{Manoharan}. 
Through discussions arising from the use of HoloPy, an invitation to travel to
Harvard University and meet with the developer to get some incite on how to
build an efficient holographic microscope as well as to learn how to properly
use HoloPy was offered.

While at
Harvard University, the Manoharan Lab graciously allowed for holograms to be
recorded using their setup so that there would be a reference set of images to
compare to the microscope
that was to be built at Acadia. The Manoharan Lab optical holography setup is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:harvardSetup}. This was a highly advanced setup allowing for
fine adjustments to be made easily to the any part of the setup. In this setup,
the samples were mounted vertically to minimize the settling of the specimens
due to gravitational effects.

A lot of the images taken at Harvard University had objects in them which were
unknown since the sample used was water from the Charles River in Boston,
Massachusetts. Not
having known what the objects were did not cause an issue since
a demonstration of holographic principles was the only purpose of looking at the objects.

The images shown in Figures~\ref{fig:128focus}-\ref{fig:3D} are meant to highlight a few different
examples where holographic imaging is superior to standard bright-field optics.
For Figures~\ref{fig:128focus}-\ref{fig:131}, the effect of the number of fringes in the hologram
on image reconstruction quality are presented at different $z$ values. 
In these images,
objects $i.$ and $ii.$ were in the same focal plane, while objects at $iii.$
were in
a different focal plane. This is why multiple values of $z$ were used in
reconstruction. In Figure~\ref{fig:129} (a), there were approximately 3 fringes
located closely around object $i.$, which were tightly grouped. In
Figure~\ref{fig:130} (a), there were approximately 7 fringes
located closely around object $i.$, which were also tightly grouped. In
Figure~\ref{fig:131} (a), there were approximately 7 fringes around object
$i.$, but the fringes were not as closely bound to object $i.$ as in
Figures~\ref{fig:129} and \ref{fig:130}. This led to there being only one
reconstruction that needed to be done since the objects at position $iii.$
could no longer be resolved. Fringe spacing affects the resolution of the
hologram, and can be shown by Bragg's Law,
\begin{equation}
    \Lambda = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}} .
\end{equation}
Matt Lehmann explains the importance of interference fringes,
\begin{quote}
Every point on the recording film and on the object will provide a
slight variation to the angular relationship and consequently a variation
in fringe spacing. Since it is the fringe spacing that delineates
the object
during reconstruction, all of the optical information about the object is
recoverable and the parallax and three-dimensionality of the
reconstruction is assured.

Since the spacing of the fringes is inversely proportional to
$\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}$, the larger the angle $\theta$ the finer the fringes.
Conversely, when the angle is small, the fringes are far apart\ldots When the
fringes are comparatively course, the hologram acts as a diffraction grating
and can be viewed by a point source of partially filtered white light\ldots As
the fringes become finer, the Bragg effect becomes apparent. This requires
fairly precise alignment of the hologram with the illuminating beam to effect
constructive refraction by the fringe pattern. The angle corresponds to the
conjugate of the reference angle during recording (i.e the angle the reference
beam makes with the surface of the hologram) \cite{Lehmann}.
\end{quote}
In the case that the recording medium is a CCD, the pixel size of the CCD must
be smaller than the smallest fringe spacing that needs to be recorded. Either
too few fringes, or fringes that are too close together will lead to a
reduction is resolution \cite{Jericho}. Therefore, as the fringes number gets
too large, the average number of pixels per fringes decreases which can cause
an unexpected loss of resolution. In Figures~\ref{fig:128focus}-\ref{fig:131},
this is apparent since for objects $i.$ and $ii.$, the details of the objects
seem to be more resolved as more fringes are added subsequently from
Figure~\ref{fig:129} to Figure~\ref{fig:131}. However, object $iii.$ was
completely lost because their were too many fringes which resulted in a loss of
resolution.


%The advantages
%in holography are that the images do not need to be in-focus to be viewed with
%good resolution. This advantage leads to the other advantage that objects do
%not have to lie in the same plane to be viewed.

beneath the focal plane of the small objects surrounding it. Both objects were

the objects, the reconstruction plane is known, and so they can be
distinguished from the particles surrounding them.

\end{figure}

Once again, in Figures~\ref{fig:136focus}-\ref{fig:140}, the difference in
reconstruction quality with the number of fringes is shown. In this case, 
more fringes led to a higher
resolution inside the object. This was because the fringe spacing was still
large enough that more fringes did indeed translate into a higher resolution.
In Figure~\ref{fig:139}, there were approximately
8 fringes around the object, and in the hologram, the object has some
artifacts about the object in it. In Figure~\ref{fig:140}, there is approximately
12-14 fringes located around the object, with the hologram looking like a white
dot, having no details like Figure~\ref{fig:139}. When reconstructed,
Figure~\ref{fig:140} more closely matches the in-focus image of
Figure~\ref{fig:136focus} than Figure~\ref{fig:139} because of this higher
fringe resolution.

In Figure~\ref{fig:148}, the fringes in the reconstruction seem to be
interfering with one another, and this reconstruction was done to see what kind
of image resolution could be achieved with these types of overlapping fringes.
With the use of the background-subtracted hologram, a highly detailed
reconstruction was obtained, and the high contrast allowed for the small
details to be seen, which were
approximately one to two microns wide.

%the reconstruction revealed more detail in the object
%than the in-focus holographic image did. This was because of the high contrast that was
%obtained in the reconstruction, using the hologram subtracted from the
%background.

Since holograms contain information of the 3-D structure of the sample, a 3-D
plot of particles movement or depth profiling within the specimen can be
performed. In Figure~\ref{fig:3Dparticle}, a particle was reconstructed over
twenty different $z$ values for a range of 30 microns. The particle was then ploted in 3-D
space. This particle was moving when it came into view, so multiple pictures
were taken over time of the same particle. This allowed for another 3-D plot to
be made that showed the movement of the particle over time.
In Figure~\ref{fig:3D}, one hundred reconstructions were done, and then they
were composed into a three-dimensional image by stacking all 100 images on top
of one another. The images were taken \SI{100}{\micro\second} apart. 
In this case, there was approximately a 1 micron movement 
of the particle along the $z$-axis, so instead of plotting this small movement,
the $z$-axis was set to be time instead, so that it could be seen how far the
particle moved in the $x$ or $y$-axis over time.
%in the $z$-axis, so instead time was used so that it could be seen how far the
%particle moved in the $x$-axis  or $y$-axis over time. 
This allowed for the
particle to be tracked in all three dimensions and in time. This is a
capability not possible with optical bright-field microscopy.

All of the reconstructions have some fine details shown which can be used to
estimate the resolution of the Manoharan Lab setup, which Figure~\ref{fig:148} gave at
least a 2 micron resolution since two micron objects can be seen in the
numerical reconstruction of the hologram.
All of the
reconstructions calculated from the Harvard University images had a pixel
spacing of 0.17 microns and the image size was 1024 by 1024 pixels.
Therefore each image is \SI{174.08}{\micro\meter} by \SI{174.08}{\micro\meter}.

\section{Harvard University}

HoloPy was the open-source Python module used for all of the reconstructions
done, and was developed by the Manoharan Lab, who is a world leader in optical
holography \cite{Manoharan}. When this module was found, the opportunity was presented to travel to
Harvard University and meet with the developer to get some incite on how to
build an efficient microscope as well as to learn how to properly use HoloPy. While at
Harvard University, the Manoharan Lab graciously allowed for holograms to be
taken using their setup so that there could be a comparison to the microscope
that was to be built. The Manoharan Lab optical holography setup is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:harvardSetup}. This was a highly advanced setup, allowing for
fine adjustments to be made easily to the any part of the setup.

A lot of the images taken at Harvard University have objects in them which were
unknown, since the sample was used was water from the Charles River in Boston,
Massachusetts. Not
having known what the objects were did not cause an issue though, since
a demonstration of holographic principles was the only purpose of looking at the objects.

    }%

\end{figure}

The images shown below show a few different
techniques of holography that is advantageous compared to bright field optics.
For Figures~\ref{fig:128focus}-\ref{fig:131}, the difference between the number of fringes in the hologram
are shown, along with reconstructions at different $z$ values. In these images,
objects $i.$ and $ii.$ were in the same focal plane, while objects at $iii.$
were in
a different focal plane. This is why multiple values of $z$ were used in
reconstruction. In Figure~\ref{fig:129} (a), there were approximately 3 fringes
located closely around object $i.$, which were tightly grouped. In
Figure~\ref{fig:130} (a), there were approximately 7 fringes
located closely around object $i.$, which were also tightly grouped. In
Figure~\ref{fig:131} (a), there were approximately 7 fringes around object
$i.$, but the fringes were not closely bound to object $i.$ like in
Figures~\ref{fig:129} and \ref{fig:130}. This led to there being only one
reconstruction that needed to be done, since the objects at position $iii.$
could no longer be resolved.


%The advantages
%in holography are that the images do not need to be in-focus to be viewed with
%good resolution. This advantage leads to the other advantage that objects do
%not have to lie in the same plane to be viewed.

       the objects.

A typical reconstruction is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:133}. Even with some
interference from objects, object $i.$ was still resolved into a clear
rectangular object whose borders are clearly visable, along with object
$ii.$, both of which were hard to distinguish in the in-focus image.

\end{figure}

Once again, in Figures~\ref{fig:136focus}-\ref{fig:140}, the difference in the
amount of fringes is shown. In this case, the more fringes led to a higher
resolution inside the object. In Figure~\ref{fig:139}, there were approximately
8 fringes around the object, and in the hologram, the object still has some
details about the object in it. In Figure~\ref{fig:140}, there is approximately
12-14 fringes located around the object, with the hologram looking like a white
dot, having no details like Figure~\ref{fig:139}. When reconstructed,
Figure~\ref{fig:140} more closely matches the in-focus image of
Figure~\ref{fig:136focus} than Figure~\ref{fig:139}.

    \label{fig:148}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

In Figure~\ref{fig:148}, the reconstruction revealed more detail in the object
than the in-focus image did. This was because of the high contrast that was
obtained in the reconstruction, using the hologram subtracted from the
background. This contrast allowed for the small details to be seen, which were
approximately one to two microns wide.

    \label{fig:3D}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:3D}, one hundred reconstructions were done, and then they
were composed into a three dimensional image by stacking all 100 images on top
of one another. In this case, there was approximately a 1 micron movement in
the $z$-axis, so instead time was used so that it could be seen how far the
particle moved in the $x$-axis  or $y$-axis over time. This allows for the
particle to be tracked in all three dimensions and in time. This is a
convenience which optical bright field microscopy does not have.


All of the reconstructions have some fine details shown, which shows the
resolution of the Manoharan Lab setup. For all of the
reconstructions done from the Harvard University images, the spacing in-between
the pixels was 0.17 microns, and the image size was 1024 by 1024 pixels,
therefore each image is \SI{174.08}{\micro\meter} by \SI{174.08}{\micro\meter}.
